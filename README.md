# BH-AprilFools2015

This is the CSS code for /r/badhistory's April Fools joke for 2015, if anyone's outright curious to see what I did. Most people honstly don't really care, but it's kind of nice to have a sort of public record of coding stuff.

In order to use this stylesheet on Reddit, [you need these images](http://imgur.com/a/sAy3R). I'm too lazy to upload the PNGs directly to GitHub (and honestly don't know where to find it), so have at it.
